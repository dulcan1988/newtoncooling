# newtoncooling
This is a very simple program for performing computations using Newton's Law of Cooling.  This is a very old program (one of my very first Java programs) and I have just now added it here if, for some odd reason, anyone might find the source code useful.

#Installation
You can simply download and run the provided JAR file, or compile the code yourself.
